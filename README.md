**environment** is a sub-project of the **BioForest** project aimed at
gathering environmental variables (to list) for data preparation within
the project.

## Project

**environment** includes all codes to access the data (in `data/`) &
analyse the data (`files.qmd`) with associated [documentation and
figures](https://bioforest-project.github.io/LoggingDiversity/).
Intermediary files and outputs can be accessed in `outputs/`. The
project takes advantage of `renv` to manage the R environment for
enhanced reproducibility.

> This will evolve to better integrate snakemake with conda

## Contribution

You can contribute to the project by forking the repository on github
and cloning the fork to your machine using several options, including
